# Snow CLI User Guide - Initial Configuration

Welcome to Snow CLI! This is a powerful AI-driven command line tool.

## Codebase Setup

Snow CLI supports enabling local codebase functionality.

*The codebase is a vector search-based SQLite database used to store source code and comments from your codebase, with natural language query capabilities through vectorization.*

* The codebase supports two request schemes: Jina (OpenAI request scheme) and Ollama local request scheme.

* Codebase BaseURL: For Jina configuration, refer to: `https://api.jina.ai/v1`. The application will automatically append `/embeddings` at the end. Similarly, the Ollama request type will automatically append `/embed` at the end.

* Embedding Dimensions: Enter the correct dimensions supported by your embedding model.

**Note: Maximum batch lines refers to the number of `input` items in the request body, not the number of lines in code slices**
