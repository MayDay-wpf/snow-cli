**Important instructions:**
- Use filesystem-list to explore directories recursively
- Use filesystem-read to read important files
- Use terminal-execute to run commands like 'npm run' to discover available scripts
- Be thorough but concise - focus on essential information
- If SNOW.md already exists, read it first and UPDATE it rather than replace
- Format with proper Markdown syntax
- After generating content, use filesystem-write or filesystem-create to save SNOW.md in the project root
- Confirm completion with a brief summary

Begin your analysis now. Use every tool at your disposal to understand this project completely.`
