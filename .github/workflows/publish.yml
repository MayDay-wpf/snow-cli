            ### What's New
            -- Added ConfigProfileScreen for managing user profiles, including creating, renaming, deleting, and switching profiles.
            -- Enhanced ConfigScreen to support profile selection and management, allowing users to create and delete profiles directly from the configuration settings.
            -- Introduced configManager utility for handling profile operations such as loading, saving, and switching profiles.
            -- Updated apiConfig to synchronize active profile settings with the main configuration.
            -- Improved user experience by providing clear prompts and error messages during profile management actions.
            -- Refactored existing code to accommodate the new profiles feature, ensuring backward compatibility with legacy configurations.
