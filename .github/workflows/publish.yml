            ### What's New
            -- Added resource monitoring functionality in cli.tsx to track memory usage and active encoders/MCP connections.
            -- Integrated resource monitoring in useConversation.ts to track encoder creation and freeing.
            -- Enhanced useKeyboardInput.ts to robustly filter out focus events from terminal input.
            --Updated websearch.ts to detect system-installed Chrome/Edge browser paths for Puppeteer.
            -- Modified ModelConfigScreen.tsx and ProxyConfigScreen.tsx to include browser path configuration.
            -- Added resourceMonitor utility for tracking resource usage and potential memory leaks.
            -- Improved textBuffer.ts to sanitize input by removing fragmented focus events.
            -- Updated MCP connection management in mcpToolsManager.ts to track connections and handle timeouts.
